TLDR, what I want this to do:
1. I log into Spotify in the UI, pick a playlist, and hit convert
2. The UI gives me the Job ID for the conversion, which I can give to someone else
3. That person logs into Apple Music in the UI and downloads the playlist to their library

Obviously this should work in both directions :)
